# Hello_World

This assignment required me to create a basic HTML webpage using these elements:
<ol>
  <li>A header</li>
  <li>A sub-header</li>
  <li>An image</li>
  <li>A hyperlink to another page</li>
  <li>A paragraph</li>
 </ol>
 
 There was also an optional added challenge of adding an ordered list (ol) <strong>and</strong> an unordered list (ul) containing three separate list elements to the webpage.
